Verse 1:
   Dm                           Bb                  F       C 
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
       Dm                          Bb                  F    C
And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound
   Dm                        Bb                       F       C
You tell me that you need me, then you go and cut me down, but wait...
   Dm                         Bb                       F         C
You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around and say..

Chorus:
         Dm                 Bb       F         C
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
           Dm                 Bb       F        C
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

Verse 2:
   Dm                          Bb                    F    C
I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you
     Dm                            Bb                       F
And I need you like a heart needs a beat (But that's nothing new)
C
Yeah yeah
 Dm                    Bb                    F             C
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue, and you say
Dm                     Bb                      F        C
"Sorry" like the Angel Heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid

Chorus
   Dm                        Bb               F
I'm holding your rope, got me ten feet off the ground...
