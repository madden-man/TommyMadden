A Drop in the Ocean | Ron Pope


Chorus:
Em          C                          G             D
A drop in the ocean,  /  A change in the weather,
     Em           C               G         D
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
         Em          C         G           D
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
       Em          C          G
But I'm holding you closer than most,
      D          C
'Cause you are my heaven.

       C              G                      D                  Em
I don't wanna waste the weekend,  /  If you don't love me, pretend
 C            G           D
A few more hours, then it's time to go.
     C                   G                              D                 Em
As my train rolls down the East coast,  /  I wonder how you'll keep warm.
    C          G        D
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on.

Pre-Chorus:
Am         G  D                        Am         G  D
Still I can't let you be,  /  Most nights I hardly sleep.
Am         G  D               C
Don't take what you don't need from me.

Chorus

C                 G                             D              Em
Misplaced trust and old friends,  /  Never counting regrets,
      C           G               D
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all.
   C            G                                    D                Em
New England as the leaves change;  /  The last excuse that I'll claim,
       C               G              D
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl.

Pre-Chorus, Chorus

Am             G         D                                Am             G         D
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore.        /        Heaven doesn't seem far away.
Am             G         D
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore.
Am             G         D
Heaven doesn't seem far away.                Chorus
