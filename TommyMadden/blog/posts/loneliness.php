Hi everybody!

So if you've gotten this far in my blog, you're probably beginning to realize that I like to jump from one topic to another in a seemingly random way. And sometimes, it is! But not this time.

Earlier this year, I wrote a blog post called <a href="http://tommymadden.com/blog/show_post.php?post_name=whatislove">What is Love?</a> where I laid out what I think love is. And although I left out much of where love comes from, and why I decided to think about that question myself, I explained that love is like the unexpected turn of all superficial emotions, like happiness and sadness, towards something truly beautiful and good. Here's a list that may help you understand:

<div>
    <div align="left" style="float: left; margin-left: 5%; width: 30%;">
        Happy
        Confident
        Carefree
        Cocky
        Apathetic
        Infatuated

    </div>
    <div align="center" style="float: left; width: 30%">Joyful
        Courageous
        Peaceful
        Humble
        Angry
        Thankful</div><div align="right" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; width: 30%;">Sad
        Afraid
        Stressed
        Insecure
        Enraged
        Disgusted
    </div>
</div>

Now when I was making this list, I was able to find something for most of the emotions I could think of, although some variants, like "enraged" versus "angry" may seem like a fine distinction.

One word, however, seemed to stand on its own: <b>Loneliness</b>.

For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what the antithesis of loneliness would be. Togetherness? Feeling accepted? Or maybe simply the feeling of being on a team?

But then, none of those things are the opposite of loneliness..Not quite. After all, any king will know that being surrounded by adoring fans and loving friends sometimes only distances a man, starving him of the intimacy and 'togetherness' he craves.

I use the word 'togetherness' for lack of a better word, but honestly, the mere fact that there seems to be no word for the feeling I am describing says something about American culture, and humanity in general (in my humble opinion).

Anyway...Sometimes being alone is not lonely at all
