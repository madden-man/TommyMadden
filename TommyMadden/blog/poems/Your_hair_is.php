
Your hair is crimson mockingbird,
Your eyes are home to fire;
Your smile evicts man's loneliness
And stifles hate’s desire.

Your teeth are winter wonderland,
Your hands as cold as ice;
Your voice can sing a playful tune
Or shout of humor’s price.

Your faith is timeless as the sea,
Your courage fights what's mild;
Your love is warm as summer day
And gently tames my wild.

Your face is fair, beyond compare, but faces are a bore --
Your beauty rests in humble quest to live with hope restored.
