
I stood alone on morning clear
Awaiting brighter days,
When suddenly from ages past
Came River Jordan’s gaze.

He slowly slithered toward me
With faith in God above
But as I searched my heart for Him
I felt not fond of love.

He said, “Son, see your sword so strong
And trust your tired toil,
From sea to sea you scrub your heart
Of tainted talent’s spoils.”

I wrestled there with fear’s desire
For insecurity,
Till what appeared but burning fire
Which stole my purity.

She said, “Seduced by brothel’s brood?
Man, you are not my first.
But bubbling blood can bribe my tongue
When apathy sings thirst.”

I wondered then what I must do
To free myself from pain,
But feeling naught save lost in thought
I ran away ashamed.

With tears I cried out longingly
For He who took my blame
But though He waited next to me
I barely knew His name.

In desperate plea and solemn stare
I turned to Him and said,
“I know Your love has no compare
But silence bites like bread.”

I listened for the whirling wind
And Spirit singing free,
But as belief still mourned in grief
My love became a tree.

It grew and grew in morning dew
Till it could lead the way
Then showed me who I wanted to
Become through darkest days.

“I live with you and heard your cry
As desperately you died
But now it’s clear through wasted tears
That I have found my bride.”

No longer shall I wait in vain
For miracles of youth,
But now I stand with hand in hand
And pray for simple truth.
