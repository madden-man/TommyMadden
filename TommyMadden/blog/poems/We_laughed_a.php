
We laughed a lot tonight
Rejoicing with the sound
Our brave old hearts could fight
The music or the ground

Instead we travel on
Till dawn and dusk depart
And let the moon and stars
Declare we are apart

There is no fear in death
When lengthy words have died
For in life's every breath
Comes love's renewing tide.
