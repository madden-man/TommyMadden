<h3>Conjunctivitis</h3>
Red and puffy my eye did swell
Soon my face was a wishing well
Drugs allowing the faintest hope
Healing comes at the hand of dope

Sure, the pain was a little strong!
Yeah, my prayers felt a little long!
But now in silence I share my pride
That through the midst of it I survived.
