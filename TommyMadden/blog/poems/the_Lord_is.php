The Lord is my home,
My rest in dark places.
The world can be crowded
With cruelly blank faces.
In youth I would wander
And search for a nest,
But now that I've found Him
His strength is my rest.

The Lord is my rock,
He's there when I'm low.
Sometimes it feels like
I'm drowning in snow.
When long words are empty
And patience wears thin,
He listens so deeply
That warmth spreads within.

The Lord is my Shepherd,
I trust in His word.
The voices inside me
Make truth seem absurd.
But bygones be bygones,
I come when I'm called,
For Love and His whispers
Make me feel enthralled.
