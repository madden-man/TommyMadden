<h3>Greatness</h3>
My heart could wrestle tyranny,
My brain could rack its shelves,
My feet could sprint there wearily,
But will we lose ourselves?
Through forests dark he delves.

I sense the promise making plans
Demanding strength and time
But while I wait with open hands
My eyes caress his rhyme...
Up mountains tall he climbs.

Will fate beat lonely, brazen gong?
Will tempers lose their men?
And in the chaos of the song
Will war be my amen?
He murders yet again.

He storms towards frozen avenues
He shouts his will of iron
And till he's lost his golden hue
He'll still pursue his siren.

His hands are mighty kryptonite
His lips sing scornful praise
His darkness seems like blinding light
Until its fire's ablaze.

He may have gorgeous women pray
To be his one and only
He may have priesthoods come and say
To him be all the glory

He may have riches stocked away
Inside his lonely circus,
But here I'll stay and rue the day
That Greatness be my purpose.
