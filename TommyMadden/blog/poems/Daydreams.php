<h3>Daydreams</h3>

In the falling of the night
When my eyes have lost their sight
I will hang on blackened light
Which cracks my lonely daydreams

Dreams and visions come to pass
Breaking hearts of men like glass
But I wonder what will last
As life bombards my daydreams

Heavy still my heart will fight
Taking all but love's first sight
Still denying me the right
Of pure and fruitless daydreams

Surely there is greener grass
But kaleidoscopes of glass
Brighten all but colored brass
Of cold and dainty daydreams
