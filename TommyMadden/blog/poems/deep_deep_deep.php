<h3>Deep, Deep, Deep</h3>

Deep, deep under
My heart has fought his thunder
Will lightning not awake?
My darkest day..

Deep, deep without
My lungs would scream for drought
I drown in blackened wake
The cold of lonely lake

Deep, deep within
his words the shape of sin
he slithers like a snake
Wanders away..
