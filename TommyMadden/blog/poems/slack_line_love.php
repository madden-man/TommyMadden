<h3>Slack Line Love</h3>

Love is like a slack line
Bouncing up and down
I look like a clown
Falling to the ground

Love is like a slack line
Listen to the vine
Heart will learn to shine
Blood will taste like wine

Love is like a slack line
Feel your courage grow
Life can seem to glow
This I've come to know

That Love is like a slack line
Across the Berlin Wall
Only twelve feet tall..
For once I shall not fall.
