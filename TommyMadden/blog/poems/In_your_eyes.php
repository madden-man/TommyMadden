
In your eyes resides a home
Far from fear and scars of old
Shoulders formed of modest gold,
Spread your wings of liquid chrome

In your skin I find my love
Wrapped in passion like a glove
Hairs of rain and wildfire,
Cleanse my every vain desire

In your hands is life and death
Restless beauty born of Eve
Humble chest so full of breath,
Sing for all that you believe

In your soul is bone of bone
In your heart is flesh of flesh
