<h3>My Greatest Fear</h3>
I do not fear Destruction’s banal game,
Though battles steal my every wisdom tooth;
The people’s hearts, they scream I am uncouth,
Yet my chagrin lies not in taking blame.
I do not fear the wild lusts of youth,
Which seek to bring my sturdy heart to shame,
Nor shouts of hate which bring me backwards fame,
So look me in the eye and see my weary truth.
Demons come and torment in the night,
But darkness casts no shadow over light;
Purity dissolves in empty fright,
But Death is suicidal in his plight.
No, greatest fears should lie in Love itself,
Which fiercely finds its way off lonely shelf.
