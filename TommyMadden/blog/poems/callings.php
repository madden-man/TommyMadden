<h3>Callings</h3>
I felt a tug like silver
Dripping down my spine
And though I felt it quiver
I knew that light was mine

The call, its pound inside me
Too fierce to just ignore
My strength had stood so lonely
With no one to adore

So soon I found another
To kiss and call my own
Her blood, her thickest thunder
Became my golden throne

Her eyes flashed lightning courage
Her hair tossed faith like rain
So catching these, I flourished
And found my given name

I longed to linger longer
To make her lips my home
With each romantic saunter
My bones became like foam

The wind was blowing ceaselessly
The ocean's salty spray
The silence sang too tenderly
That truth would soon decay

I grabbed my hat and jacket
I kissed my love goodbye
My mouth, it made a racket
As normal went to die

My feet will take me upwards
Towards endless years of strife
But crumbling pride will suffer
Till death returns my life
Till death returns my life
