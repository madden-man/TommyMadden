
i met a girl who was wilder than dreams
She filled me up till I burst at the seams
Light had surrounded her, flying in beams
To bring me abundance of bread.

i met a girl who despised every day
That people would come try and take me away
Loyal, she fought for the music to play
To wake me from tyrants of dread.

i met a girl who pursued me with fire
Dancing, so regal, to trumpet and lyre
Never ashamed of her purest desire
To give me a new scarlet thread.

i know a girl whose blood has been shed
i know a girl who could never be dead
