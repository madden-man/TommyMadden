
Although some friends abandon lonely way,
In every chilly day my eye is keen.
Though some vain promises may last a day,
Believe in me, that I'll protect my queen.
Humility has far too high a gaze
For simple men to look it in the face
Yet Iâ€™ll remain, with countenance unfazed
Providing honest comfort through the race.
Races never purify the soul,
Unless in every step you know your worth;
Valor oftentimes forgets to grow,
Unless you let your rain barrade the earth.
I'll never learn to love the winter night,
Yet for the sake of love I'll learn to fight.
