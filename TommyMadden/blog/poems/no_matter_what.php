No Matter What

Every line of crack that man may sneeze
Every word of jack that man may breathe
Every change in tack that man may grieve
Woman, believe, no matter what.

Every empty word that woman lies
Every tear absurd that woman cries
Every useless girdle woman buys
Man, let her rise, no matter what.

Many chances human frailty wastes
Many fountains human tongues may taste
Many seasons human love feels chaste
Love, come with haste, no matter what.

When you feel cut, or in a rut,
What is your no matter what?
