
When violence refuses to be named,
Resisting every torrent of the truth,
Your faith will have no fear of the untamed,
For ransomed courage leads to endless youth.
You see, the world in such a different way
Corrupts the purest love and clean desire,
But faith is not dependent on the day
And man, he has no power over fire.
The world has no more knowledge of the cross
Than silver feet that aimless run a race,
But gentle love will triumph over loss
Once God reveals His purpose, and His face.
No force of hell can quench undying beauty,
So you, dear friend, are safe from deathâ€™s cruel duty.
