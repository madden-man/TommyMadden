
There was a man who loved the Lord
But bored of bread on Sundays
So soon he stored it in a hoard
Behind the chapel's stairway

His wife had seen him steal away
As many times as forty
So soon she prayed he'd eat his way
Back into heaven's glory.

The pastor was a dirty dude
That always stank of herring
But, smelling food, he thought it rude
That someone wasn't sharing!

They all were slaves to thoughts of sin
That THEY were in the right
But though they grin, and weep within,
To God they were alright.
