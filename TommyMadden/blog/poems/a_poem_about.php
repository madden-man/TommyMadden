<h3>A Poem About Me</h3>

Time has a way of removing your pain
Just as a father condemning the weeds
But how do you find what is hidden inside
If never you're given a moment to breathe?

One man alone may have treasure inside
Hidden for none but his muscles to find
But when you awake and are turned from the lies
The truth makes you wonder where passion resides?

Hard work, for certain, can earn a man plenty
Many a man have learned that one by twenty
Luck has a way of not finding the guilty
But only when airwaves unseen start to glisten

I've watched a man go from brother to friend
I've seen a girl turn and forsake her land
I've grit my teeth in a cold barren wasteland
And I've been the one who confides in my waistband

But who, may I ask, is the judge of such actions?
Who of all creatures reigns over the pastures?
Sometimes I find that my words carry meaning
But softly and quickly that glimpse seems to trickle

Over and under, over and back
Watching the ladies preparing their tack
Where have the men gone with feet ever open?
Why is the spoonful of medicine broken?

Here I will sit, surely here shall I stay
Hoping that someone will catch him someday
If it were me, I would surely not listen
Those voices inside hardly care for an instant
