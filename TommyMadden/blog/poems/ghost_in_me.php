
Great big rock of fiery terror
Look on me and smell my pain
For with every tearful sorrow
I forsake the ghost in me

Every silence whispers sonnets
Wakening the ghost in me
But my soul knows playful smiles
Like it loves the ghost in me

Who am I, who looks for passion?
What is he, who screams and wails?
Every lie becomes his fortress
Every truth will blacken death

Soon my waking eyes will see him
Then my soul may banish mayhem
