Nature's hue and morning dew
Spells wonder and amazement,
But magic fades from crystal rain
And earth turns into pavement.

Greenish golds and blues are bright,
Correcting me towards greatness,
But children smell, and never tell,
That regal thoughts are tasteless.

What kind of love can strangers bear?
What kind of hope would sway me?
But through the lies I've found the wise
And of the earth they daydream.
