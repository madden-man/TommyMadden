<h1 style="text-align: center">Rivers and Roads</h1>
There was a hermit who lived on the side of a mountain. He was a rugged man, with calloused hands and a long beard that came down to his waist. His eyes were tired in a way, as if he had seen things that no man could unsee; however, if people were to look closely, they might discover the burning fire and determination in his heart. He was strong, with enough courage to hunt and kill creatures much larger than he, yet he carried a walking stick with him everywhere he went. He was altogether odd in the eyes of the townspeople.

This town was hemmed in by the ocean, to the west, and the mountain, to the east. The mountain was so massive that it blocked out the sun until late in the morning. The town would be shrouded in darkness, and the people completed little work save the minimal pottery and smithing learned by the few craftsmen. The townspeople never ventured onto the mountain. In fact, they stayed away from its wilderness because, despite the plentiful food and the meat of the beasts who resided there, the people’s creed held that Jupiter had instructed them to never cross the river Sarno that lay facing the mountain. This was never questioned by the people and rarely spoken of, being voiced only to teach this doctrine to their children while they were still very young.

The river Sarno was a massive river with no easy crossing by any man’s standards, so people recognized it as holy and pure. They never dumped waste into it, fearing the wrath of their greatest god Jupiter, so it was clean and life grew on either side of it. When the darkness lingered in the early hours of the morning, the light of the sun could be seen only in reflections of the waters; yet the water in the river was dark and mysterious, and no townsperson would be found anywhere near it except perhaps in times of drought, when it would run as strong as it always had.

There was a council in the town, titled the Council of Five, which included two Roman leaders called to speak for the great Emperor Vespasian and three advisors representing each of the town’s great temples. The first great temple was dedicated to the Roman god Jupiter, where people would go to seek strength and power for their weaknesses. The second great temple was that of the god Apollo, where people would plead for skill in hunting and knowledge of the future, as well as mercy in times of plague. Lastly, the third great temple was created for the god Isis, who was considered the compassionate mother of the people, and women went to this temple for prayers of birth giving, for a harvest, or for spring rain. This Council of Five managed the town by making decisions for the good of the community.

One day, the hermit came down from his mountain. The townspeople had spread legends about him because, in all his peculiarity, they struggled to find some magic about him. The hermit was too ignorant of the townspeople to notice their obsession, but his ignorance made him appear godlike to the people. As he trudged through the sacred Sarno river, people flocked to him, wondering at his clothes, his hair, and the large bearskin slung over his shoulder. One even bowed to the ground out of respect, taking him for some kind of god, but he simply grunted and walked past them, straight to the blacksmith with a fire erupting in his eyes.

The blacksmith’s name was Caelius. He was a strong man, hands often blackened by his trade, and was generally well-liked by the Romans despite his refusal to engage in the worship of the gods. Being about six feet tall, Caelius was respected and, though not on the Council of Five, was fiercely loyal to the people, advising them occasionally according to his personal beliefs. His blacksmith shop was located in the center of town, which made him an accessible outlet for advice. When the hermit walked up to him, Caelius dropped the finished sword into water to cool and embraced him. The hermit grunted in unexpected discomfort and flapped his arms helplessly as some bewildered townspeople watched the strange interaction.

“Hail!” Caelius exclaimed. “How have you been, living as a legend on that mountain?”

“Legend?” The hermit raised an eyebrow.

“Why, yes!” Caelius replied. “All the townspeople see you as some kind of god among men, to live on that mountain with --”

“I am no god.” The hermit pronounced these words carefully.

“I know that,” Caelius said happily.

After a long moment of silence, the hermit dropped the bearskin at Caelius’ feet. “I need your handiwork.”

“Anything for you. What do you need?” Caelius returned to the sword he had dropped in the water and removed it, balancing it in one strong hand.

“I need to make a boat.” He eyed Caelius and the sword.

“Oh, well, talk to Livius then. He’s a carpenter and --”

“I don’t need a carpenter, I need you.”

Caelius paused for a moment, and then declared, “I am with you always. Where you go, I will go.” He smiled broadly, obviously excited at the prospect of such an adventure.

The fire in the hermit’s eyes brightened. “Then let us go.” He turned to leave, and the half-circle of townspeople (which had grown as the conversation continued) parted to let him pass.

Caelius stopped him. “Wait, we should at least buy wood if we’re to build a boat. Have you any gold?”

The hermit stared at Caelius with a look of surprise.

“Yes..I thought not. One moment.” Caelius left momentarily to retrieve a small sack of gold which was his whole life’s earnings from his job as a blacksmith.

“Bring some metal. We will need it.” The hermit turned again and walked away at a strong pace. Caelius grabbed a large sheet of his finest iron and ran after him.

Caelius and the mysterious hermit, followed by nearly half of everyone who was in the town at that time, went to the outskirts of the small town where Livius had made his abode; immediately noticing there were no trees anywhere near his house. By the time they arrived, the townspeople were no longer following them.

The hermit knocked on the door to Livius’ house with his staff, and an old woman exited, her countenance full of fury.

“I BET YOU’RE LOOKING FOR LIVIUS, AREN’T YOU?” She screamed at the top of her lungs.

Caelius shuffled his feet; but the hermit stood tall, unperturbed. “Where?” asked the hermit with a blank expression.

“OH, YES, I SEE, NO ONE WANTS TO MEET THE ELDERLY WOMAN WHO LIVES WITH LIVIUS. OH, NO. THEY JUST WANT --”

At that moment, Livius stepped out of the door. He was not outrageously tall, but not short either. He was very thin, with a short stubbly beard and workman’s clothes. Like Caelius, he did not participate in the rituals of the three great temples in the town, but he said that he believed in their gods because he feared the wrath of the townspeople. Presently, he spoke over his angry mother. “Hey, hey, ma, calm down. Caelius, what are you doing with this odd man?”

Caelius shot a look of fierce indignation at Livius. “He’s my friend!”

“Yes, I’m sure he is,” Livius retorted. “What do you need?”

“You have some wood for us.” The hermit pointed to the lumber by the side of Livius’ house.

“Really, we could use your expertise,” Caelius cut in. “We’re trying to build a boat.”

Livius smiled. “I see. Well, that’s certainly going to cost you, friend. How much gold do you have for bargaining?”

Caelius retrieved his sack of gold and showed it to Livius proudly. Livius looked impressed.

“Well, I suppose being a blacksmith has its benefits…” Livius looked at the sack with a lust for its contents, and subconsciously offered a hand to receive the gold.

“It’s all yours if you help us.” Caelius dropped the gold into Livius’ outstretched arm, awakening him from his trance.

“Deal!” Livius grinned. The hermit grew an expression of disgust as he stared into the man’s black pupils, focused as they were on receiving their loved possession.

For the next four days, the three men worked tirelessly to produce a strong boat. Caelius slept inside with Livius, while the hermit simply laid outside on the ground because, as he insisted, “I don’t need a bed!”. The blacksmith used every drop of his finest iron to line the outside of the small boat with the metal, retrieving some every so often from his shop. The boat was relatively small, having room for only three people and no seats. Caelius and Livius had several disagreements on the design of the vessel, but Caelius usually won the arguments. The hermit used with the quiet wisdom which he always carried with him to settle these disputes. Neither Caelius nor Livius knew why they were creating the boat, after all.

When they finally finished constructing their boat, the hermit walked away unexpectedly. Caelius smiled. “And so the adventure begins. Get the other end, will you?” Livius grudgingly nodded.

Caelius and Livius followed the hermit at a slow pace, carrying the heavy boat as fast as they could. After a while the hermit somehow noticed that he was far ahead of them both, and sat down patiently. When they caught up to him, he set off again at the same fast pace.

“How do you know where we’re going? What’s the hurry?” Livius asked, grunting from the weight of the boat.

The hermit stopped abruptly, looking Livius in the eye. Caelius stopped as well. Pointing to a cloud, with the fire blazing in his eyes, the hermit spoke in a tone different from any Livius had ever heard before. “Storm coming.” Pausing just a moment longer, he set off even faster than before.

Caelius took a deep breath and followed. Livius sighed and, after just a few steps, continued, complaining in an obnoxious tone.

The three walked back into town, and people gathered around the hermit hoping for a statement from the legend who had finally come down from his mountain, and they finally received their wish. It was nearly sunrise in the town.

It was not as the townspeople expected, however.

The hermit stopped for a moment in front of the people, and Caelius set down the boat. Livius dropped it, exhausted, and sat down. About thirty people stood around the hermit as he faced them. “Any who follow me at this time will be saved,” the hermit stated simply. “Those who deny me will be destroyed.” Immediately, the hermit became a prophet in the eyes of the people.

For a full minute, all the people, including Livius and Caelius, were spellbound by his words. The lead priestess from the temple of Isis named Junia finally spoke. She had dark hair, stunning dark blue eyes, and a mastery of tongue which could disarm the bravest of politicians. Her incredible beauty was said to be blessed by the god Isis, and in her participation of the carnal rituals of Isis, her body became an offering for the entire town. Presently she asked, “Is the apocalypse near?” Junia was one of the most influential leaders in the Council of Five.

“No one will know the hour when that time comes.” The prophet looked up at the sky. “I know you consider me to be a god, but I am just the opposite. I may only be a man, but you must listen nonetheless. If you disbelieve, you will certainly be destroyed. Who shall follow?”

None stepped forward. In this short instant the hermit had sunk from godlike status to the insanity of a deranged prophet who lived on a mountain. Finally Junia spoke again. “Caelius, are you going with this man?”

Before all the people who respected him, Caelius declared, “I have faith in this man. Yes, I am going with him.”

Junia looked distressed for a second, but the expression was gone in an instant. “I will return, I must consult the other temples. What is your name, prophet?”

The prophet turned towards the wilderness across the river. He finally smiled and said, “Silvanus.”

She went away, and the people slowly dispersed. The man who had previously bowed before the hermit of legends walked away disgustedly, as if he had expected more of the prophet. Livius lay outstretched on the ground, as Silvanus the hermit turned, sat down, and began to meditate. Caelius remained standing, watching Silvanus patiently and occasionally looking up at the bright sky.

Livius looked at the prophet’s meditation with loathing and finally interrogated Silvanus spitefully. “So, all-knowing prophet, how will the world end? Huh, Silvanus? Forest-boy? Where did you learn the answers of the universe? Answer me!”

Silvanus remained silent. The sun rose over the mountain and sunlight streamed onto him where he was sitting. A smile flashed across his face, but it was gone as quickly as it had come. After that, they waited there for some time without movement from him.

Finally Junia returned from meeting with the leaders of the other temples. “I am coming, Silvanus. I must learn more about your home in the wilderness and how you say we will be destroyed.”

Silvanus nodded, stood up, and looked at Caelius. “Let us go, then.” He picked up his staff and began walking toward the mountain. Caelius and Livius took hold of the vessel and followed the prophet, as Junia followed behind.

They walked through town, carrying the boat, until they reached the edge of the Sarno river. The hermit crossed immediately, but the others stopped out of instinct. A look of fear grew like cancer on Livius’ face. Silvanus patiently waited for the others on the other side, watching to see if they would follow him past the ultimate barrier: breaking the town’s sacred rule. Finally Caelius found courage, and, holding the boat, stepped into the rushing river. Livius forced himself to follow, holding the other end of the rowboat and stepping in tentatively. He winced at the freezing cold of the river. Junia, however, remained, watching them enter.

After they reached the other side, Caelius finally turned to face Junia. “Have you ever touched this river?”

“No..I’ve never been near it.” Junia’s fear was finally fully exposed, and she said, “The Council didn’t say…”

“It doesn’t matter what the Council said or didn’t say. This river gives life, it is nothing to fear.” Caelius smiled reassuringly at her, glowing with faith. She smiled back joyfully for a moment, and stepped into the river.

Silvanus said prophetically, “Once you cross this river, you will not come back unchanged.”

Junia stopped. Looking straight at Silvanus, with a look of incredulity, she asked, “Am I to be a god?”

Silvanus frowned. “You are to be a witness to the wrath of God!” He exclaimed with a powerful voice.

“Which?” In this way Junia announced her faith in the gods as she began to cross. Silvanus turned away.

When Junia had reached the other side, they walked into the forest the town had always tried to ignore, facing the fear of the unknown that had always been brought by the wilderness. Silvanus understood their fear but did not acknowledge it, maintaining a quick pace through the jungle of trees. It became darker as they entered because of the enormous trees surrounding them with darkness. There were so many that they formed a canopy of sorts, and the forest became so dense that the group could barely see. Livius slipped several times on the upward slope of the mountain, and finally asked, “How long must I toil until I receive my payment?”

Silvanus replied, “Until your work is finished.” This was not mentioned again.

Livius had so much trouble carrying the boat that Junia tried to help, but her small frame could not handle its weight. Silvanus took the end and continued on his path. Finally, they reached a flat part of the mountain. Silvanus stopped walking and the others stopped as well. They were all exhausted, and sat down as soon as they arrived. A small stream ran across the terrace, and the remains of a fire had left the trees above scorched to pieces, so the adventurers could see the light of day, which was a relief to all.

Night came swiftly, and they were left without beds to sleep on. Livius complained loudly, grumbling, “This isn’t worth the payment...I won’t stand for this.” He did, however, falling asleep on the soft leaves. Caelius and Junia slept soundly on the ground also, and Silvanus meditated in the center of the flattened land for half the night until he finally let sleep overtake him.

In the morning, Silvanus got up immediately and started walking. Livius woke up as well and asked, disgruntled at the time of day, “Must we leave now?”

“Yes.” Silvanus looked Livius in the eye, then began walking up the mountain. Livius groaned, woke up the others, and followed Silvanus up the mountain.

They walked for a long while, until suddenly Silvanus stopped and crouched low to the ground. The others followed his lead, confused at his action. Livius started to speak, but the prophet looked at him sharply, holding up a finger to tell him, “No speech.” Livius and Caelius put down the boat, while Junia remained crouched. She quivered with excitement.

Silvanus crawled through the leaves, silent as a fox. Staff in hand, he suddenly stood up and dashed over to the other side of a small brook they had been following. Looking every direction, he started yelling and dancing around in the leaves. His chanting produced an incredible amount of noise with the acoustics of the mountain’s slope, and the hermit seemed crazy in the eyes of his companions.

Livius looked upon the prophet with a grimace. “This is sick. What chanting to some unknown god is this? Who does he --”

Caelius quieted him with the same hand signal the prophet had used. Junia still stared with eyes of wonder, expecting to see a new world of demons and gods explode from the ground Silvanus was standing on.

And still Silvanus chanted, as they watched, until suddenly a wolf appeared on the opposite side of the mountain. Walking towards Silvanus, the wolf began to snarl and ran towards the prophet. Caelius started to get up, but Livius grabbed his leg to stop him.

Silvanus saw the wolf and ran towards it. He slid through the leaves first and kicked the wolf with his bare feet, and the wolf recoiled from the pain and blood in its mouth. Silvanus got to his feet, walked over to the wolf, and hit it hard with his staff. It tried to bite back, but Silvanus hit it again and it was too weak to fight. It died quickly, and Silvanus knelt for a moment. When the moment passed, he threw the wolf on his shoulders and returned to the others.

“Where are we?” Livius cried in despair and fear for his life.

“We are in the world of choice,” the hermit said. “The world of fear or no fear, the world of God or no God. You have come to find the Truth, have you not?”

“Yes,” said Caelius and Junia without hesitation. Livius stared at the ground for a long while, then looked over the landscape. The trees were green and the brook was rushing with pure water. The view was incredible, and they could see the town from the high vantage point through a break in the canopy. Finally Livius looked up at the clouds and the sun high in the sky. And for the first time, he declared passionately that he wanted to be different. He fought the expectations of the villagers and announced to the world as loud as he could, “I have!”

“Then let us continue. I will show you the way.” Silvanus lingered on Livius’ eyes lovingly for just a moment, then guided them further up the mountain at a slower pace.

Caelius and Livius picked up the boat again, following Silvanus up the steep incline without a pause for breath. The air felt fresher to Livius, his arms felt stronger, and his breaths became deeper. Livius finally lived, for the first time in his life, and every moment was a blessing to him. Caelius noticed the change in Livius’ heart, wondering at what this simple prophet had done in only one day to this man.

The slope became steeper and steeper, but Livius was no longer affected by the toil of his hands. There were less trees now than before, so the darkness of the canopy was not as pronounced. After they walked for another few hours, they came upon another flat place just as it was becoming dark. “How did we find such a perfect resting place when we needed it, master?” he asked.

“The question is not how, but why,” Silvanus said wisely. “And though we will never know why, we can only know that God provides.”

“Do you speak blasphemy or do you speak of the great god Jupiter?” Junia asked aggressively.

“I speak Truth.”

“You speak lies.”

Silvanus looked at the sky again, closing his eyes. “Follow me, Junia.” He walked to the east, and after a moment’s hesitation, Junia followed him.

As they walked, Junia asked, “My gods are the gods of my father, and my father’s father. Who are you to say they are not the way of truth?”

“You say it already in your heart,” Silvanus said. “You are here to prove it to yourself.”

“Not true!” Junia exclaimed. “You say the gods of Jupiter and Juno, for whom I am named and have formed my life, are man-made, of the world, rather than from the realm beyond ours!”

“God will reveal himself to you, my friend,” Silvanus said tenderly. “Open your heart to Him and you will see the Truth.”

At that moment the two of them entered a large garden. It was clearly a man-made garden, as there were rows of plants for harvest, watered by the rain and by the brook which ran through it. It was beautiful, with trees all around yet none blocking the incredible view stretching for many miles. Fruit hung bountifully from the branches of the plants, and Junia looked upon it all in amazement. “This is..beautiful! This could be no one but the gods!” she proclaimed in her wonder.

This time Silvanus did not protest her cries, but walked straight through the enormous garden to the center. At this center, there was a fruit unlike the others. It was green on one side and red on the other. Silvanus picked the fruit off the plant.

“Junia, this is the fruit of Truth. In it is the knowledge of Good and Evil, yet the lack of distinguishing between them. In it is the beautiful gift of choice, but also therein lies the poison of sin, waiting to overtake you.”

Junia looked at the fruit in wonder. “So I just eat this and I will…...know?”

Silvanus looked at her with a smile. “In eating this fruit, you choose to fight the devil head-on. Eating this fruit is what began the great Battle between Good and Evil, giving man the ability to choose God or not. Then God had made punishment for this action, but today there is no punishment for eating this fruit. Today, you may eat the fruit to join in the battle against the normal, to always seek out the Truth rather than accepting lies, and to choose a path to take instead of following the path of destruction blindly.”

Junia thought for a moment. And this moment grew into an hour. And this hour turned into five. The moon came out over the garden, revealing its majesty, enticing Junia to think harder, think harder!

Until Junia realized that she didn’t need to think harder. She needed to listen. And when she stopped thinking for just a moment, she saw again the beauty of the moonlight, the harvest of the fruit, and the gift of choice before her. And she bit into the fruit with no shame.

Silvanus looked lovingly at Junia for her willingness to accept choice, but Junia, confused, said, “I feel no different. Do I need to eat the whole fruit?”

Silvanus replied softly, “No...Truth is not a feeling, it is a willingness to accept it. You may now choose. Let us return to the others.” Silvanus walked the path back toward the others, and slowly, Junia saw the forest for what it was. It was not something to fear or an unknown realm full of mystery. It was a forest. And Junia saw through open eyes for the first time since she had been a child.

The night passed, and eventually the sun rose. Silvanus smiled brightly at the light brought by the sun, saying, “What bright light God shines down upon us.”

Junia looked at the sun, and instead of seeing Apollo’s chariot, she saw the sun. The sun, just as it was, for the first time -- and it was beautiful.

Junia and the prophet returned to the others soon after that. They continued their journey immediately when they got back, but it was not easy, for the slope was steep. Dragging the boat as best they could up the steep incline, Caelius struggled to pull it while Livius pushed with all his might. Finally Caelius cried in desperation, “What do we need this boat for, master?”

Silvanus said nothing, but helped Caelius to pull the boat.

After dragging the boat up the very top part of the mountain, the adventurers finally arrived at the top. They dragged it to a flat place and collapsed, feeling absolutely exhausted from the work they had done. Caelius told Silvanus, “Alright, master, we’re at the top. How much farther shall we go?”

Silvanus looked at Caelius and said, “Have faith, Caelius.”

Caelius spluttered and yelled at the top of his lungs from the mountain, “HOW MUCH FAITH MUST I HAVE?”

The travellers were silent for a long while. Caelius sat in desperate anguish at his own lack of faith, crying and hating himself for it.

Finally Silvanus said, like a whisper, “Enough to climb mountains.”

And Caelius smiled again. After sinking into such a pit of self-pity, he again saw Silvanus the way he was, and accepted the moment for what it was. He stood up, brushed himself off, and picked up the boat. Livius smiled as well, as broad as Caelius always had, and gripped the other end.

Silvanus led them to the very top of the mountain where there was a massive pit a hundred feet wide. In it they could barely see red liquid, which seemed to be rising slowly. After they watched for a while, Caelius asked, “What is it?”

Silvanus looked on it with amazement and replied, “It is the judgment of Pompeii. But we are here to be saved. This will destroy many lives, but through that suffering will come peace for the nations, and increased faith for those who believe.”

Then Silvanus jumped off the side of the mountain. It was not a sheer rock face, but it was almost vertical. Somehow he landed in a tree a little ways down and caught the branch, pulling himself to safety. The others followed him the long way down, with the boat, until they found him on the other face of the mountain. He was standing by a brook which was tiny, but ran off the very top of the mountain. And he declared, “This is where my journey ends, and yours begins, my friends. I will not live to see the judgment of Pompeii, but you will be saved because you listened to God when He spoke to you. Be wary that people do not turn your faith into something it is not, making you seem to be deities of your own making. Instead, choose your path wisely and love God first and foremost. Love your neighbor second. And love yourselves third. I will never leave you, for I am only leaving this world to find another.”

By the end of this speech Junia seemed sad. She asked quietly, “You’re leaving?”

“Yes, my dear. But not before I rename you after the God who created you, rather than the gods who you have found to be the downfall of your town. So your name, if you choose to accept it, may be Batya, which means Daughter of God.”

By now Junia’s cheeks were soaked in tears, and she hugged Silvanus. “Thank you.”

Livius had been watching from afar, but Silvanus looked on him with love again. “Livius,” Silvanus said in a harsh tone. “Throw your god off the mountain.”

“What?” Livius asked surprisingly. “I have no idol here!”

Silvanus did not respond to this, but looked long and hard at Livius.

“But, master. You paid me for the job and for all the work..”

Livius was silent. In that instant he knew he was at the crux of choice to believe or not to believe. He prayed to God that he would be given strength, but felt no different. He cried out to Silvanus, but Silvanus said no more. He beat his hands relentlessly on the stone on the mountain, not caring about the pain and blood, but the earth did not swallow him up.

And when Livius finally woke up again, he saw the gold in his hand in a different light. He saw a fist bloodied by the idol in his hand, and a mind poisoned by the lies of money and of the village.

Livius threw the gold as far as he could.

And Silvanus smiled and said, “You will no longer be named after envy and the short life of those who seek God in the places where He is not. You will no longer be named for the destruction of your ancestors: you will be named after the rebirth of your soul today. And your name, if you choose to accept it, may be Athanasios, for you will live a long, abundant life.”

Caelius looked hopefully at Silvanus and asked, “Shall I receive a new name too, master?”

Silvanus replied, “Son, you have had faith from your childhood. I gave you your first name, and I need not give you a second. Always walk in the ways of your Lord, and choose wisely as you have your whole life.”

Now Silvanus paused, enjoying the world for the last time he would ever experience it. Until he finally said, “Follow this brook until it becomes a stream, and follow that stream until it becomes a river. Use this boat to escape the destruction of your town, and, my friends, find another mountain to climb.” The fire in the hermit’s eyes blazed brighter than ever before, and he ran away without another word.

And then the world exploded.

The three adventurers followed the brook as it went down the mountain as fast as they could, fearing the wrath of God above all else but trusting that He would deliver them. Ash rained from the sky, and the whole earth was in turmoil as the mountain vomited out red liquid as hot as the sun. The travellers finally found where the brook turned into a strong river, dove in with the boat, and paddled as fast as they could. The current swept them along, but they could see the red liquid at the top of the mountain, beginning to seep down.

The red liquid seeped into trees, destroying them with its fury and heat, and pushed on towards the small town of Pompeii where the people now saw the extent of their fate. But the three adventurers, currently nameless and searching for Truth, sailed down the river until they came to a fork in the river. The west went to the destruction of the town, while the east went to the possible safety of the ocean. The sojourners, trusting God, went to the east, and found safety.

Caelius asked them then, “Which names do you choose?”

“I choose my name to be not of my ancestors, but that of myself. I choose my name to be not of my idols, but of my Father. I choose my name to be Batya. Daughter of the one True God.”

“And I choose my name to be not of my gold, but of my soul. I choose my path to be for God, and not for the world which has not proven to be enough for my soul. I choose my name to be Athanasios, and to have a long life of abundance.”

“And I choose my name to be that of my Father, who art in heaven. This Father, who provided for me such an amazing worldly father that he would train me in the ways of walking with the Lord. I choose my name to be Caelius.”

And these are the beginnings of the three hermits who chose their paths to take. They will forever remember the destruction of their hometown Pompeii, but they will not remember it as a sorrowful event that their God had to do to punish those that lived there. They will forever see it as a reminder to the world that only self-destruction can come from finding pleasure in temples of this world, and idols made by the work of men. We must always choose to choose, despite the fear of the normal which is the human condition. So, my friends, listen to the lives of these three prophets as you may, and find another mountain to climb! Grace and peace to you.

Amen.
