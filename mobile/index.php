        <p style="text-decoration: none; color: black">Saferide was designed to be an Uber-like app for Chapman students looking to
        get a ride home safely. This program was already in place at Chapman, but I wanted to streamline
        the process and enable both the drivers and the riders to communicate more effectively. Ultimately,
        another team developed an app, because I had shifted my priority towards other projects, but I
        contributed to the final product as well through my ideas and by sharing my code.</p></a>

        <h1 style="font-family: Ubuntu, serif">TrueVine Project</h1><br><br>

        <p>TrueVine was designed to be an app integrating the communication of Slack
        with the organization of Google Calendar, thereby helping people to lead college organizations
        better and manage what events were happening when. It is still a work in progress, and is not
        publicly available because it will be implemented at InterVarsity, a club at Chapman, in the Fall.</p>
