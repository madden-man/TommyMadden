Key details of Massive MIMO implementation for high power/long range as well as indoor and repeater solutions are laid out.</SUMMARY><NEWSLINETEXT>A comprehensive analysis of 5G mm-wave systems to identify the optimal configurations, semiconductor approaches, and client device expectations.  Many questions on RF implementation have now been answered in RRH and handset design, and detailed power consumption and cost analysis shows the likely choices of OEMs.  Cost estimates for network and handset/hotspot implementation show the direction for operators.  A forecast through 2025 includes base station and RRH deployment (macro and small cell), as well as CPEs, mobile handsets, hotspots, tablets, and IoT devices.</NEWSLINETEXT><BYLINE>Joe Madden</BYLINE><SOURCE>Mobile Experts, Inc.</SOURCE><KEYWORDS>5G mmwave millimeter 5GNR AAS active antenna rrh UE CPE client forecast</KEYWORDS><ATTACHMENT>MEXP-5GMMWAVE-19 rev0 ericsson.pdf, MEXP-5GMMWAVE-19 rev0 ericsson.xlsx, </ATTACHMENT></NewsItem>
