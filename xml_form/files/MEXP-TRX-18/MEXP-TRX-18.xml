units, and related radio transceivers for mobile communications. The&#13;
forecast is broken down by band, by power level, by region, by MIMO&#13;
configuration, by traffic density, by level of BBU integration, and by OEM&#13;
market share. This year, we added a view of how much capacity (in Gbps)&#13;
is shipped for each air interface)</NEWSLINETEXT><BYLINE>Joe Madden</BYLINE><SOURCE>Mobile Experts Inc.</SOURCE><KEYWORDS>Macro base station rrh transceiver massive mimo mmimo forecast gsm millimeter wave mmwave</KEYWORDS><ATTACHMENT>mexp-trx-18 rev2 ericsson.pdf, mexp-trx-18-rev3 ericsson.xlsx, </ATTACHMENT></NewsItem>
