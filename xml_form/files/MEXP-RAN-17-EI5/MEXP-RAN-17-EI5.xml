This short report gives background data and explains how the traffic density data correlate with network features.</SUMMARY><NEWSLINETEXT>Benchmarking data for multiple mobile operators in different countries are used to create a clear correlation between Gbps/km2/MHz (GkM) traffic density and the use of small cells and Massive MIMO.   This report includes future projections of network features based on expected growth in traffic density.</NEWSLINETEXT><BYLINE>Joe Madden</BYLINE><SOURCE>Mobile Experts Inc.</SOURCE><KEYWORDS>Mobile Experts Inc.</KEYWORDS><ATTACHMENT>MEXP-RAN-17-EI5.pdf</ATTACHMENT></NewsItem>
