The growth in demand is illustrated by the growth in cord cutting in the USA and expected demand will outstrip the capacity of the bands below 6 GHz.  The charts show a clear illustration of how mm-wave bands will come into play, and the amount of capacity needed from mm-wave sites.</NEWSLINETEXT><BYLINE>Joe Madden</BYLINE><SOURCE>Mobile Experts, Inc.</SOURCE><KEYWORDS>mm-wave 5G cbrs laa capacity demand</KEYWORDS><ATTACHMENT>MEXP-RAN-18-EI4.pdf, , </ATTACHMENT></NewsItem>
