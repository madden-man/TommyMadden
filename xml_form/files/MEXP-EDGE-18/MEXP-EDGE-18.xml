&#13;
Economic analysis weighs the cost of Edge Computing in every radio (with the best possible latency) against the revenue opportunities dependent on low latency.   Is it worthwhile to put computing at the very edge, or is there a more optimal solution??  Analysis of multiple applications illustrates a likely outcome of this optimization question for typical operators.&#13;
&#13;
A five-year forecast is included for services, hardware and software related to Edge Computing.</NEWSLINETEXT><BYLINE>Joe Madden, Frank Rayal</BYLINE><SOURCE>Mobile Experts Inc.</SOURCE><KEYWORDS>MEC mobile edge computing multi-access edge computing latency forecast ec </KEYWORDS><ATTACHMENT>mexp-edge-18 rev0.pdf</ATTACHMENT></NewsItem>
