</SUMMARY><NEWSLINETEXT>"Smart Cities are often listed as an exciting area of IoT development, with vast improvements in quality of life for city residents.   According to media reports, smart city traffic will flow without stopping, crime will be reduced, and the earth will stop warming up. While some key applications have reached mainstream adoption, some other applications will be adopted slowly over a long time without any integration with the existing IoT networks.   Smart traffic control, security/surveillance, and transport management are examples of newer smart city applications that are likely to be implemented separately from the waste bins and streetlights already deployed in the city.&#13;
&#13;
The bottom line is that we see the Smart City area as a healthy contributor to the overall IoT market, with wireless connectivity in many cases.   The Smart City market should grow into the tens of millions of devices per year by 2022, with some devices (such as traffic control or transport) requiring high reliability and commanding higher prices.   We see this as a growing marketâ€”but without enough synergy to justify a common-platform all-inclusive approach. &#13;
